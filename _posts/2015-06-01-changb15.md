title: Learning to Search Better than Your Teacher
abstract: 'Methods for learning to search for structured prediction typically imitate
  a reference policy, with existing theoretical guarantees demonstrating low regret
  compared to that reference. This is unsatisfactory in many applications where the
  reference policy is suboptimal and the goal of learning is to improve upon it. Can
  learning to search work even when the reference is poor? We provide a new learning
  to search algorithm, LOLS, which does well relative to the reference policy, but
  additionally guarantees low regret compared to deviations from the learned policy:
  a local-optimality guarantee. Consequently, LOLS can improve upon the reference
  policy, unlike previous algorithms. This enables us to develop structured contextual
  bandits, a partial information structured prediction setting with many potential
  applications.'
