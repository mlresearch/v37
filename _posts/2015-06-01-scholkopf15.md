title: Removing systematic errors for exoplanet search via latent causes
abstract: We describe a method for removing the effect of confounders in order to
  reconstruct a latent quantity of interest. The method, referred to as <i>half-sibling
  regression</i>, is inspired by recent work in causal inference using additive noise
  models. We provide a theoretical justification and illustrate the potential of the
  method in a challenging astronomy application.
