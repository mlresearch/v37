title: Variational Generative Stochastic Networks with Collaborative Shaping
abstract: We develop an approach to training generative models based on unrolling
  a variational auto-encoder into a Markov chain, and shaping the chain’s trajectories
  using a technique inspired by recent work in Approximate Bayesian computation. We
  show that the global minimizer of the resulting objective is achieved when the generative
  model reproduces the target distribution. To allow finer control over the behavior
  of the models, we add a regularization term inspired by techniques used for regularizing
  certain types of policy search in reinforcement learning. We present empirical results
  on the MNIST and TFD datasets which show that our approach offers state-of-the-art
  performance, both quantitatively and from a qualitative point of view.
